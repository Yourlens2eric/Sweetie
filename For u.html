Something just clicked inside me, and there was a recognition that this was the beginning of something wonderful.No matter what anyone said,I'm ready to pay everything for you.I love you,sweetie,forever and never change,no matter what happens, I will always love you,and I also promise to always make you happy.No matter how difficulities there are,i can face them all,cauz having you by my side is enough.You have made me see that life has so much to offer, that life is colorful and beautiful, not drearily dull as I used to see it.I love you,you are truly the one for me.I never want to be without you. I want to grow old with you by my side.
